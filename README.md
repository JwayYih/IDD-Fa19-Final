IDD Final

We are creating an interactive LED nightstand. The goal is to have 4 distinct LED strips inlayed in the surface of the table top which can be operated by a capactive touch sensing interaction.

Designing the table in SolidWorks

SolidWorks part was converted to an SVG file for Shaper Origin to recognize

Used the Shaper Origin handheld CNC to cut out the table top
