# IDD Final

**A documentation by Johnway Yih and Samson Schirmer**

## The Project
We are creating an interactive LED nightstand. The goal is to have 4 distinct LED strips inlayed in the surface of the table top which can be operated by a capactive touch sensing interaction.

## Step 1: The Woodworking
Designing the table in SolidWorks

SolidWorks part was converted to an SVG file for Shaper Origin to recognize

Origin uses computer vision to create and augmented reality workspace. It uses a patterned tape which is placed on the work surface to register its location. Then with its precision motors it precisely cuts along the uploaded image.

Used the Shaper Origin handheld CNC to cut out the table top

Here is the setup with the Shaper Tape

This is the touch interface used to load and place designs as well as adjust all cut parameters (depth, inside/outside/pocket cut, offsets, etc.)

Here are the cut outs of the top two surfaces

Used the Festool track saw to cut out the legs

All components cut out

Used the Shaper Origin and a tenon jig to create the mating tenons on the legs

All the completed components in an exploded view
